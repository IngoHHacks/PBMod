## Pirate Boss Mod ##
Adds a pirate boss battle to Act 1. Currently overrides the trapper/trader boss.<br>
Note that it is a pre-release, so a lot of things may still change. Please send me any feedback or suggestions you have.<br>

The mod is tested with vanilla, but there shouldn't be any issues with using other mods, but keep in mind that it depends on **API 1.12**.
